Amazon EC2 provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Key exam concepts:

- **Instance Types**:
    - General Purpose (M7g, T4g, M7i, T3, M7a, M7gd)
    - Compute Optimized (C7g, C7i, C7a, C7gd)
    - Memory Optimized (R7iz, X2idn, X2iedn, R7a, R7g, U7i family, I7i, I7ie)
    - Accelerated Computing (P4d, G5, VT1, P5en, Trn2)
    - Storage Optimized (Im4gn, Is4gen, I4i)

- **Pricing Models**:
    - On-Demand (short-term needs)
    - Savings Plans (1-3 year commitment, restricted to single end customer usage from June 1, 2025)
    - Spot Instances (up to 90% discount)
    - Reserved Instances (capacity reservation, restricted to single end customer usage from June 1, 2025)
    - Dedicated Hosts (physical servers for your use)
    - Dedicated Instances (EC2 instances on single-tenant hardware)
    - Capacity Reservations (reserve EC2 capacity for any duration)

- **Advanced Features**:
    - Nitro System (enhanced security & performance)
    - Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) for HPC and ML networking
    - Capacity Blocks for ML (reserved GPU capacity for specific durations, leveraging new AI/ML instances like P5en, Trn2)
    - EC2 Instance Connect for browser-based SSH
    - EC2 Fleet and Spot Fleet (combining On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot Instances)

- **Best Practices**:
    - Use Instance Metadata Service (IMDSv2) for enhanced security
    - Enable Detailed Monitoring for <1-minute metrics (CloudWatch)
    - Leverage Placement Groups (Cluster, Spread, Partition) for specific workload needs
    - Utilize EC2 Auto Scaling for elasticity and high availability
    - Implement AWS Systems Manager for operational automation
    - Continuously monitor and optimize costs using AWS Cost Explorer and Compute Optimizer

EC2 is a core service in AWS, and it is used by millions of customers around the world. It is a powerful and flexible tool that can be used to build and run a wide variety of applications.
