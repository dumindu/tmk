Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a block-level storage service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. EBS volumes provide persistent storage for applications running on EC2 instances. EBS volumes are replicated within the Availability Zone in which they are created to protect against data loss.

EBS volumes are available in five volume types:

- **General Purpose SSD (gp3):** Recommended for most workloads. Baseline 3,000 IOPS and 125 MB/s throughput, scalable to 16,000 IOPS and 1,000 MB/s.
- **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 Block Express):** Highest performance SSD for mission-critical applications. Supports up to 256,000 IOPS and 4,000 MB/s throughput per volume. Supports Multi-Attach.
- **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1):** Cost-effective for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads like big data.
- **Cold HDD (sc1):** Lowest cost HDD for less frequently accessed workloads.
- **io1 (Legacy):** Previous generation Provisioned IOPS SSD.
- **gp2 (Legacy):** Previous generation General Purpose SSD.
- **EBS Snapshots Archive:** Cost-effective long-term storage for EBS snapshots.

EBS volumes can be attached to EC2 instances at any time, and they can be resized up or down without downtime. EBS volumes can also be used to create snapshots, which are point-in-time copies of an EBS volume. Snapshots can be used to create new EBS volumes, or to restore an EBS volume to a previous state.

EBS is an important part of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. The Well-Architected Framework is a set of best practices for designing and building cloud architectures. The Well-Architected Framework recommends using EBS for persistent storage for all applications running on EC2 instances.

Here is some additional information about EBS that you will need to know to pass the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam:

- EBS volumes are attached to EC2 instances using block device mappings.
- EBS volumes can be encrypted at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
- EBS volumes can be encrypted in transit using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
- EBS volumes can be used to create RAID arrays.
- EBS volumes can be used to create boot volumes for EC2 instances.
- EBS volumes can be used to create root volumes for EC2 instances.
- EBS volumes can be used to create data volumes for EC2 instances.
