Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a cloud-based, elastic file system that provides a simple, scalable, and durable way to share files across multiple Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances and on-premises servers. EFS is a fully managed service, so you don't have to worry about provisioning, managing, or scaling your storage.

EFS file systems are highly available and durable, and they can scale to petabytes of data. EFS also provides strong consistency and file locking, making it a good choice for a wide range of workloads, including web applications, content management systems, and databases.

Here is some short information about EFS that you will need to know to pass the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam:

- EFS is a fully managed service, so you don't have to worry about provisioning, managing, or scaling your storage.
- EFS file systems are highly available and durable, and they can scale to petabytes of data.
- EFS provides strong consistency and file locking.
- EFS can be used with EC2 instances, Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), AWS Lambda functions, and AWS Fargate.
- EFS can be used to store data for a wide range of workloads, including web applications, content management systems, databases, and machine learning.
- EFS One Zone storage class for cost-optimized storage.
- EFS Replication for cross-region data protection.

Here are some additional details about EFS that you may want to know:

- EFS uses the Network File System (NFS) protocol to provide access to file systems.
- EFS file systems can be mounted on EC2 instances in your virtual private cloud (VPC).
- EFS file systems can be accessed from on-premises servers using AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN.
- EFS file systems can be encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
- EFS file systems can be used to create RAID arrays.
- EFS file systems can be used to create boot volumes for EC2 instances.
