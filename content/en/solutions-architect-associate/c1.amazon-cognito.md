Amazon Cognito is a fully managed user identity and access management (IAM) service that allows you to easily add user authentication, authorization, and management to your web and mobile applications. Cognito provides features such as user registration, sign-in, sign-out, password recovery, and access control, so you can focus on building great user experiences.

Cognito can be used to authenticate users with a variety of methods, including:

- **Username and password**
- **Social login** (e.g., Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple)
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** with SMS or TOTP
- **Custom authentication schemes** (e.g., using AWS Lambda)
- **SAML and OIDC federation** for enterprise identities

Cognito can also be used to authorize users to access your resources. For example, you can use Cognito to create user groups and roles, and then assign permissions to those groups and roles. This allows you to control who has access to what resources in your application. Cognito integrates with AWS IAM for fine-grained access control.

Cognito is a fully managed service, so you don't have to worry about provisioning, managing, or scaling your IAM infrastructure. Cognito is also highly available and durable, so you can be confident that your users will be able to access your application when they need it.
