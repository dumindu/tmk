The AWS Well-Architected Framework is a set of guiding principles for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective cloud architectures. It consists of six pillars:

- **Operational Excellence:** Focuses on running and monitoring systems to deliver business value and continuously improve supporting processes and procedures.
- **Security:** Focuses on protecting information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
- **Reliability:** Focuses on the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.
- **Performance Efficiency:** Focuses on using computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and maintaining that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
- **Cost Optimization:** Focuses on avoiding unnecessary costs. This includes understanding and controlling where money is being spent, selecting the most appropriate and right-sized resources, analyzing spend over time, and scaling to meet business needs without overspending.
- **Sustainability:** Focuses on minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads. This includes a shared responsibility model for sustainability between AWS and the customer.
