AWS core services are the foundation of the AWS cloud platform. They provide the basic building blocks for building, deploying, and managing cloud applications. Some of the most important core services include:

- **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):** A web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

- **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3):** An object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

- **Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS):** A web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.

- **Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS):** A web service that provides block storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.
