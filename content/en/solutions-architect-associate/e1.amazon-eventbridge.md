Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easy to connect applications together using events. It allows you to decouple and scale microservices, serverless applications, and legacy applications. EventBridge can detect events from a variety of sources, including AWS services, applications, and connected devices. It can then route those events to targets such as AWS Lambda functions, Step Functions state machines, Kinesis streams, and Amazon SNS topics.

Here is some short information about Amazon EventBridge that you will need to know to pass the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam:

- EventBridge is a serverless event bus that makes it easy to connect applications together using events.
- It allows you to decouple and scale microservices, serverless applications, and legacy applications.
- EventBridge can detect events from a variety of sources, including AWS services, your custom applications, and SaaS applications (via EventBridge SaaS integrations).
- It can then route those events to targets such as AWS Lambda functions, Step Functions state machines, Amazon Kinesis streams, Amazon SNS topics, and other AWS services.
- EventBridge is a highly scalable and reliable service that can handle millions of events per second with low latency.
- It is also a cost-effective service, as you only pay for the events that you process and deliver.
- EventBridge Schema Registry allows you to discover, manage, and share schemas for events.

Here are some additional details about Amazon EventBridge that you may want to know:

- EventBridge can be used to build a variety of serverless applications, such as real-time data processing pipelines, event-driven architectures, and notification systems.
- It can also be used to integrate AWS services with each other, with your custom applications, and with third-party SaaS applications.
- EventBridge is a powerful tool that can be used to simplify and automate your application architectures, promoting loose coupling and scalability.
- EventBridge Pipes allow you to build point-to-point integrations between event sources and targets with optional filtering and enrichment.
- EventBridge supports API Destinations for invoking HTTP APIs.
- EventBridge supports EventBridge Archive for long-term event storage.

Here is an example of how Amazon EventBridge can be used to build a serverless application:

- You have an application that generates a new event whenever a new customer order is placed.
- You can use EventBridge to create a rule that routes this event to an AWS Lambda function.
- The Lambda function can then process the order and send a confirmation email to the customer.
- You can also use EventBridge to create a rule that routes the event to an Amazon SNS topic.
- This topic can then be used to notify other systems about the new order, such as your inventory system or your CRM system.

This is just one example of how Amazon EventBridge can be used to build serverless applications. EventBridge is a flexible and powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems.
