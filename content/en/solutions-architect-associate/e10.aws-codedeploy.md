AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that helps you automate application deployments to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, on-premises instances, serverless applications (AWS Lambda), and Amazon ECS/EKS container services. CodeDeploy makes it easy to reliably deploy code and infrastructure changes to your applications.

CodeDeploy works by deploying your application code to a set of instances or serverless functions. CodeDeploy then routes traffic to the new deployments and monitors the deployment to ensure that it is successful, with options for automatic rollback.

CodeDeploy can be integrated with a variety of AWS services, such as Amazon S3, AWS CloudFormation, and AWS CodePipeline. This allows you to automate the deployment process for your applications.
