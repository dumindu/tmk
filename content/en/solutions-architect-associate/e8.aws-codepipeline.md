AWS CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service that helps you automate the release and deployment process for your applications. CodePipeline builds, tests, and deploys your code every time there is a change, so you can release new features more frequently and reliably.

CodePipeline works by modeling and automating the steps required to release your software. You can create a pipeline that includes the following stages:

- **Source stage:** The source stage retrieves the code from your source code repository, such as AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, Bitbucket, or Amazon S3.
- **Build stage:** The build stage compiles, packages, and tests your code using services like AWS CodeBuild.
- **Test stage:** (Optional) The test stage runs additional tests on your code.
- **Deploy stage:** The deploy stage deploys your code to your production environment using services like AWS CodeDeploy, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or AWS CloudFormation.

CodePipeline can be integrated with a variety of AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), AWS Lambda, and AWS CloudFormation. This allows you to use CodePipeline to automate the release and deployment process for a wide range of applications.
