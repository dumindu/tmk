AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service that automates the build, test, and packaging of your software. It scales with your needs and helps you to release high-quality software more quickly and reliably.

CodeBuild works by building your code in a Docker container environment, executing the build commands that you specify in your buildspec file. The buildspec file is a YAML file that defines the steps that CodeBuild should take to build and test your code.

CodeBuild can be integrated with a variety of AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and AWS CodePipeline. This allows you to automate the build, test, and deployment process for your applications.
