## What is AWS and how does it work?

AWS is a cloud computing platform that offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, analytics, application, and deployment services that help organizations move faster, lower IT costs, and scale applications. AWS's services are built to be scalable and reliable, and they can be accessed on demand from anywhere over the internet.

### How AWS works:

AWS operates a global network of data centers, called regions. Each region consists of one or more Availability Zones (AZs), which are isolated from each other to protect against service disruptions. AWS customers can choose to run their applications in a single region or in multiple regions for higher availability and redundancy.

To use AWS, customers create an AWS account and then sign up for the services they need. AWS offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, so customers only pay for the resources they use.

## Explain the difference between EC2 and Lambda.

**EC2** (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a compute service that allows customers to launch virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud. EC2 instances can be used to run any type of application, including web servers, databases, and application servers.

**Lambda** is a serverless compute service that allows customers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda functions are triggered by events, such as HTTP requests, database changes, or S3 object uploads.

### Key differences between EC2 and Lambda:

| Feature | EC2 | Lambda |
|---|---|---|
| Provisioning | Customers must provision and manage EC2 instances. | Customers do not need to provision or manage servers. |
| Pricing | Customers are billed for EC2 instances based on the instance type, region, and usage. | Customers are billed for Lambda functions based on the number of executions and the amount of memory used. |
| Use cases | EC2 is a good choice for applications that require persistent storage, high performance, or fine-grained control over the server environment. | Lambda is a good choice for event-driven applications, such as serverless web applications, mobile backends, and data processing pipelines. |

## What is the AWS Well-Architected Framework?

The AWS Well-Architected Framework is a set of best practices and design principles that help customers build secure, reliable, efficient, and cost-effective applications on AWS. The framework is divided into six pillars: operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability.

## Describe AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management).

AWS IAM is a service that allows customers to manage access to AWS resources. IAM allows customers to create users and groups, and to assign them permissions to AWS services and resources. IAM also allows customers to control access to AWS resources using policies.

IAM is a critical part of any AWS deployment. It helps customers to protect their resources and to ensure that only authorized users have access to them.

## What is the difference between Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB?

**Amazon RDS** (Relational Database Service) is a managed database service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. Amazon RDS supports a variety of database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

**Amazon DynamoDB** is a fully managed, multi-region, multi-master, durable NoSQL database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications. Amazon DynamoDB offers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.

### Key differences between Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB:

| Feature | Amazon RDS | Amazon DynamoDB |
|---|---|---|
| Database model | Relational | NoSQL |
| Schema | Required | Optional |

| Querying | SQL | Key-value, document, and secondary indexes |
| Use cases | Web applications, enterprise applications, and OLTP workloads | Mobile applications, gaming applications, and IoT applications |

## What are Amazon VPC and subnet?

Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a service that allows customers to create a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where they can launch AWS resources in a private network. A VPC can be used to create a secure and isolated environment for running applications, storing data, and deploying development environments.

A subnet is a range of IP addresses within a VPC. Subnets are used to group AWS resources together and to control how they interact with each other. For example, you could create a subnet for your web servers and another subnet for your database servers.

## What is the significance of an AWS Availability Zone?

An AWS Availability Zone (AZ) is a physically isolated location within a region. Each AZ has its own power supply, cooling, and networking infrastructure. AZs are designed to be highly reliable and to isolate applications from failures in other AZs.

When you launch an AWS resource, such as an EC2 instance, you can choose to launch it in a specific AZ. This helps you to ensure that your applications are highly available and to protect them from failures in other AZs.

## What is an S3 bucket?

An Amazon S3 bucket is a storage unit that holds objects in the AWS cloud. S3 buckets are designed to be highly scalable and durable, and they can be used to store a variety of data types, including web files, images, videos, and backups.

S3 buckets are a popular choice for storing data because they are easy to use and offer a variety of features, such as versioning, encryption, and life cycle management.

## What is Amazon CloudWatch, and how is it used?

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides data and insights to help customers monitor their AWS resources and applications. CloudWatch collects metrics, logs, and events from AWS resources and applications, and then stores this data in a secure and highly available data store.

CloudWatch can be used to monitor a variety of things, such as CPU utilization, memory usage, network traffic, and application errors. CloudWatch also provides features such as alarms, dashboards, and analytics to help customers to visualize and understand their monitoring data.

## Define the term "Elastic Load Balancing" in AWS.

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is a service that distributes traffic across multiple AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, Auto Scaling groups, and containers. ELB helps to improve the performance, availability, and scalability of web applications.

ELB can be used to distribute traffic across multiple AZs in a region, or across multiple regions. ELB also provides features such as health checks, sticky sessions, and automatic scaling to help customers to manage their traffic load.

## What is Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, and how does it work?

Amazon Elastic Beanstalk is a platform that makes it easy to deploy and manage web applications on AWS. Elastic Beanstalk takes care of all the infrastructure details, such as provisioning and managing servers, load balancing, and auto scaling. This allows developers to focus on writing and deploying their applications.

To use Elastic Beanstalk, developers create an application and then choose a platform (such as Java, PHP, or Ruby). Elastic Beanstalk will then create the necessary infrastructure and deploy the application.

Elastic Beanstalk can be used to deploy applications of all sizes, from small personal websites to large enterprise applications. It is also a good choice for applications that need to be scalable and highly available.

## Describe the use cases for Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS.

Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a messaging service that allows customers to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SNS publishes messages to multiple subscribers, such as AWS Lambda functions, HTTP/S endpoints, and mobile devices.

Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications by asynchronously exchanging messages between components.

### Use cases for Amazon SNS:

* Sending notifications to users, such as email, SMS, or push notifications.
* Decoupling microservices by sending messages between them.
* Triggering AWS Lambda functions.
* Integrating with other AWS services, such as Amazon Kinesis and Amazon DynamoDB.

### Use cases for Amazon SQS:

* Decoupling microservices by asynchronously exchanging messages between them.
* Buffering messages between applications.

* Retrying failed messages.

## How does AWS Lambda handle concurrent executions?

AWS Lambda can handle concurrent executions by scaling the number of containers that are running the function. Lambda will automatically scale up the number of containers as needed to handle the increased load.

Lambda also uses a technique called "work stealing" to improve the performance of concurrent executions. Work stealing allows Lambda to redistribute work among containers that are not fully utilized.

## What are AWS CloudFormation templates, and how do they work?

AWS CloudFormation templates are JSON or YAML files that describe the AWS resources that you want to create. CloudFormation templates can be used to create a wide range of AWS resources, including EC2 instances, RDS databases, and S3 buckets.

To use a CloudFormation template, you first create the template and then deploy it to AWS. CloudFormation will then create the resources that are described in the template.

CloudFormation templates are a good way to automate the deployment of AWS resources. They can also be used to create and manage complex AWS architectures.

## Explain the differences between Amazon S3, EBS, and EFS.

**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is a highly scalable, object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Amazon S3 is designed to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.

## How do you secure your AWS resources using Security Groups and NACLs?

Security groups and NACLs are two complementary security features that can be used to protect your AWS resources.

**Security groups** are firewall rules that control inbound and outbound traffic to your EC2 instances. Security groups can be applied to EC2 instances at launch or at any time.

**NACLs (Network Access Control Lists)** are firewall rules that control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. NACLs are applied to all resources in a subnet, regardless of whether they are EC2 instances, RDS databases, or other types of resources.

To secure your AWS resources using security groups and NACLs, you can follow these best practices:

* **Use security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to your EC2 instances.** Only allow the traffic that is necessary for your applications to function.
* **Use NACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.** This can help to protect your resources from unauthorized access.
* **Use least privilege.** Only grant users the permissions that they need to perform their jobs.
* **Monitor your security groups and NACLs regularly.** Make sure that they are still meeting your security needs.
